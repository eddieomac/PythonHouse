Creating a collection of rooms and items in python.

I'm learning Object-Oriented Programming in Python on Futurelearn.com

Please help me add more rooms and link them together.

Add rooms by adding the following code to main.py:

newroom = Room("Insert New Room Name")

newroom.set_description("Insert New Room Description.")

Link rooms by adding the following code to main.py:

firstroom.link_room(roomtolinkto, "direction to link")

roomtolinkto.link_room(firstroom, "opposite direction to direction to link")

Please note that links only go one way so you have to repeat the process in the opposite direction.

Example:

kitchen = Room("Kitchen")

kitchen.set_description("A dank and dirty room buzzing with flies.")

kitchen.link_room(dining_hall, "south")

dining_hall.link_room(kitchen, "north")

Add Enemies by adding the following code to main.py:
name = Enemy("Name", "description of character.")
name.set_conversation("What you want the character to say!")
dave.set_weakness("item that will be the enemy's weakness")
room_where_enemy_should_be.set_character(name)

Add Friends by adding the following code to main.py:
name = Friend("Name", "description of character.")
name.set_conversation("What you want the character to say!")
room_where_enemy_should_be.set_character(name)
#Note, friends don't fight friends so they don't have any weaknesses.

Example:

dave = Enemy("Dave", "a smelly, hungry zombie.")
dave.set_conversation("Brrlgrh... rgrhl... braaains...")
dave.set_weakness("brains")
dining_hall.set_character(dave)

catrina = Friend("Catrina", "a tall friendly skeleton.")
catrina.set_conversation("Why hello there, friend!")
ballroom.set_character(catrina)
